## Usage:

&nbsp;When the application is opened, users are presented with a landing page that provides a link to the notes page. Clicking on this link takes users to a page where existing notes are listed in the left-hand column, while the right-hand column contains empty fields to enter a new note title and text. As soon as a user starts entering a new note, a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page. Clicking on this icon saves the new note, which then appears in the left-hand column alongside existing notes. Clicking on an existing note in the left-hand column displays it in the right-hand column, allowing users to view and edit its content. Finally, clicking on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page presents users with empty fields to enter a new note title and text in the right-hand column.
